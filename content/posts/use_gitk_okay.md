One of my favorite tools for visualizing what has changed in git is `gitk` if you are not familiar this little command will open up a new window in the context of the current branch by default. It has a graph overview, a diff window, and a tree of files with changes. I am a visual person so this tool has been invaluable to me when working on a project. There are ways to do this with the command line and something like SourceTree can get you this plus more; however, I like to do 90% in the command line and go to the GUI when I am at a loss or want a simple representation.
